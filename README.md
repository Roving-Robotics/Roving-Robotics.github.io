# RovingRobotics Portfolio Mockup

Static frontend that mirrors the provided dark terminal-style résumé layout.

## Quick start
1. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or run a local server).
2. Optional: run a quick dev server with Python if you prefer:
   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   ```
3. Edit content directly in `index.html` and tweak styling in `style.css`.

## Assets
- Profile placeholder lives at `assets/avatar.svg`. Drop in your own photo with the same file name to swap it instantly.

## Notes
- Typography uses the JetBrains Mono family from Google Fonts; an internet connection is required on first load to fetch it.
- Layout is responsive down to mobile while keeping the terminal aesthetic.
